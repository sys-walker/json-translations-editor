    <h1>About the editor</h1>

    <p>
      This is the first language editor (at least as far as I know) for angular written with HTML ,CSS and JS.
      <br />
      The editor is suitable for "@ngx-translate/core" or other library wich uses JSON for translations.<br />
      The UI is inspired by Android Studio's Language editor.
