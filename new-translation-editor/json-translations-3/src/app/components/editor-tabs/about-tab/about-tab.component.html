      <h1>About the editor</h1>
      <p>This is the first language editor (at least as far as I know) for angular written with HTML ,CSS and JS.</p>
      <p>The editor is suitable for "ngx-translate/core" or other library wich uses JSON for translations.</p>
      <p>The UI is inspired by Android Studio's Language editor.</p>
